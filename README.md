# lab-4-pkg

geometry-demo is a minimal Python package designed to demonstrate how to scaffold a clean and importable module with a simple public API. In this project, you'll create a basic package structure, write and run unit tests using pytest, and install the package in editable mode to verify that it can be imported from other scripts. The package includes a geometry_demo directory for core logic, a tests directory for test cases, and standard packaging files like setup.py. Once installed with pip install -e ., you can run pytest to execute your tests and confirm functionality. If you finish early, consider tackling optional stretch goals like input validation, expanded tests, or packaging for PyPI.
